## About Po-Nan Li

Born and raised in Taiwan, Po-Nan (colloquially as Ponan) is a machine learning engineer at Apple. He specializes Python, C/C++ and Matlab programming for scientific computation and computational imaging. Prior to joining Apple, he received his PhD degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, where His research interests lied in X-ray and computational imaging, biological computation and machine learning. During 2019 summer, he interned at [Google Daydream](https://arvr.google.com/daydream/ "Google Daydream"), where he developed camera calibration instrumentmentation for AR devices. During 2020 fall, he interned at [Facebook Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) (now Meta Reality Labs), where he used machine learning to accelerate the waveguide design for AR wearables. 

During 2016-2017, Po-Nan served as the Vice President of Stanford Taiwanese Student Association [(STSA)](https://web.stanford.edu/group/stsa/ "Stanford Taiwanese Student Association (STSA)"). Prior to joining Stanford, he has earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from National Tsing Hua University [(NTHU)](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php "National Tsing Hua University"), Taiwan.
