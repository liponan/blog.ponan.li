## About Po-Nan Li

Born and raised in Taiwan, Po-Nan (colloquially as Ponan) is currently a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. He specializes Python, C/C++ and Matlab programming for scientific computation and computational imaging. His research interests include X-ray and computational imaging, biological computation and machine learning. During 2019 summer, he interned at [Google Daydream](https://arvr.google.com/daydream/ "Google Daydream"), where he developed a camera calibration instrument for AR devices.

During 2016-2017, Po-Nan served as the Vice President of Stanford Taiwanese Student Association [(STSA)](https://web.stanford.edu/group/stsa/ "Stanford Taiwanese Student Association (STSA)"). Prior to joining Stanford, he has earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from National Tsing Hua University [(NTHU)](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php "National Tsing Hua University"), Taiwan.
